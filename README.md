# Hospital Management System (C++)

This project was implemented as part of a required assignment to apply fundamental programming concepts in C++.

## Project Description
A simple hospital management system that manages patients based on medical specializations.
Each specialization has a limited queue, and patients are handled according to their priority
(urgent or regular).

## Required Concepts Applied
This project was required to demonstrate understanding and correct application of the following concepts:

- Arrays
- Structures (struct)
- Functions
- Conditional statements (if / switch)
- Loops (for / while)
- Queues (using arrays)
- Basic input/output (cin / cout)
- Modular programming
- Problem decomposition
- Priority handling (urgent vs regular patients)

## System Features
- Supports 20 medical specializations
- Each specialization has a maximum of 5 patients
- Priority is given to urgent patients
- Add new patients
- Remove attended patients
- Display all waiting patients per specialization
